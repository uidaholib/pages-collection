# pages-collection

**Active Development on this project has moved to [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh)**

https://github.com/uidaholib/pages-collection

A project to generate a free and simple digital collection site using [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

See [Getting Started Docs](docs/index.md) for detailed information.

`pages-collection` is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

Similar learning experiences use [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) or other DAMS/[CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) platforms that are overkill for one off projects.
Although CMS feature familiar GUI administration interfaces, they are not simple to learn and customize.
`pages-collection` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example.
A project in "minimal computing", it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

Skillz:

- Git and GitHub basics
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- commandline literacy
- GitHub collaboration and project management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data

**Note:** 
Since `pages-collection` uses gh-pages, it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images.
GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.

> We prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV spreadsheets over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

## Features

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for gh-pages 
- Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
